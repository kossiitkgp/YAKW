    We are a group of like minded people bonded together by the spirit of Open-Source, focused on our love for coding.
    KOSS holds events to familiarize students with UNIX tools, Linux environment, Git Development Workflow, practice
    Algorithms and Data Structures, besides conducting workshops on GUI programming, Web development, Android
    application Development and Hackathons.
    <br /><br />
    As a Society, we hope to inculcate and foster the spirit of Open-Source in the students of IIT Kharagpur.

  <p class="about-description">
    Simply put, Open source refers to software or projects that are made freely available for anyone to use, modify, and
    distribute; encouraging collaboration and sharing among a community of developers and users.
    <br /><br />
    Open source culture embodies the boundless spirit of collaboration and knowledge-sharing that underpins the modern digital
    landscape. At its core, it champions the idea that software, technology, and creative works should be accessible to all,
    unhindered by proprietary barriers. This culture invites diverse minds to contribute, modify, and improve upon existing
    projects, fostering a global community of creators and problem solvers.
    <br /><br />
    Much of modern technology stands on the sturdy foundation of open source software. From the operating systems that power
    our computers and smartphones to the intricate frameworks that enable web development and cloud computing, open source
    components are woven seamlessly into the fabric of our digital lives.
