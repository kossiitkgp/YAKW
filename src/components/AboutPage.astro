    The Kharagpur Open Source Society (KOSS) is a community of open source enthusiasts at IIT Kharagpur. We collaborate
    on innovative open source projects, applying cutting-edge solutions to real-world problems. The community promotes
    knowledge-sharing and personal growth in a supportive and engaging environment.
    <br /><br />
    Each year, we organise events introducing students to open source culture, Linux technologies, Git version control workflows
    and various software technologies. These events are instrumental in fostering a culture of technology education, hands-on
    learning, and collaborative knowledge exchange within the community.

  <p class="about-description">
    Simply put, open source refers to software or projects that are made freely available for anyone to use, modify, and
    distribute; encouraging collaboration and sharing among a community of developers and users.
    <br /><br />
    Open source culture embodies the boundless spirit of collaboration and knowledge-sharing that underpins the modern digital
    landscape. At its core, it champions the idea that software, technology, and creative works should be accessible to all,
    unhindered by proprietary barriers. This culture invites diverse minds to contribute, modify, and improve upon existing
    projects, fostering a global community of creators and problem solvers.
    <br /><br />
    Much of modern technology stands on the sturdy foundation of open source software. From the operating systems that power
    our computers and smartphones to the intricate frameworks that enable web development and cloud computing, open source
    components are woven seamlessly into the fabric of our digital lives.

  <p class="about-description">
    Participation in open source development provides hands-on exposure to various technologies and coding techniques,
    serving as a rich platform for skill development and learning. Contributing in open source projects has the positive
    byproduct of improving software that is usable by a variety of users and giving back to the community.
    <br /><br />
    Participation in open source goes beyond writing code; it involves networking and teamwork within a large international
    community. You create professional connections and broaden your knowledge base by working on projects and interacting
    with knowledgeable developers.
    <br /><br />
    Additionally, the chance to solve complicated problems, exhibit creativity, and participate in projects supporting your
    ideals increases personal fulfilment. Open source participation ultimately taps into creativity, knowledge sharing, and
    the limitless potential of a group effort, providing a dynamic environment where people of all skill levels can thrive
    and actively participate.
